# Bootstrap
Repository of initialization and startup files for a users linux account that implement default Mu2e standards

Use of the initialization files in this package (.vimrc, .emacs, etc) is optional.  These files provide an
example of how to configure your editor so that your code will meet Mu2e standards, but there alternative
settings to some fields (such as the number of spaces to interpret a tab) that still meet Mu2e standards.
These files must be copied into a users home directory, at which point they will take effect on the next invocation
of the editor.  Users are free to edit their private copies of these files, but the default values in the
repo should not be changed without first discussing with the Computing Coordinators.
